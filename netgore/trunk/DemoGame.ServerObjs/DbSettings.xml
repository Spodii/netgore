<!-- 
When this file resides in the solution, it contains the default settings and the settings to use by
tools outside of the main project (such as the installation validator). While in here, changes to this
file will end up being under version control, which causes obvious problems if you are using version
control as people will end up overwriting each other's database connection settings.

When this file resides in the Server's settings path (\Content\Settings\), it contains settings specific
for this machine, and is not under version control. These are the settings that will be used by the
server.

If you need to change the database connection information, please do so by changing the settings in
the copy in \Content\Settings\. If no file exists in there, the Server will create it when run.
