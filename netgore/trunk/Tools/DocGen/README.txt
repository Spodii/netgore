This file does not actually contain the documentation, just the files used for generating the documentation. If you are looking for the documentation, it can be found on the NetGore site at:

http://www.netgore.com/docs/index.html

If you wish to generate the documentation for whatever reason, you will need to install Doxygen and its dependencies.
